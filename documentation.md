-	To get understanding of what's necessary 
-	First problem – relay doesn’t fit correctly in the breadboard 
  -	Question: should we consider Arduino Cloud app for our project? 
    - Depends – she knows very little 
    - Python more reliable 
  - How to connect water pump (thin cables) to relay and GND 
    - screwable terminals 
    - pay attention about pitch 
    - solder – take some wire – digital lab soldering iron – solder wire to one side of this – to make a connection 
  - Do we need a relay module – doesn’t fit breadboard 
  - Moisture sensor – highest was 87% and lowest 56% - even though 
  - Generally our circuit – is this correct with the power supply being external? 
    - More stable if its on the breadboard 
    - 9V battery not really good doesn’t hold that long 
    - Can also try powering it through USB cable 
        •	Plugged supply more reliable 
        •	Make sure its 5V 
        •	Or through the thing we use for battery – PLUG can then be changed manually on
